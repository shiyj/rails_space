Dr. Townes received his M.A. in physics from Duke University in 1936 and his Ph.D. in 1939 from Caltech with a thesis on isotope separation and nuclear spins. Dr. Townes worked extensively during World War II in designing radar-bombing systems and holds a number of patents in related technology. He then turned his attention to applying the microwave technique of wartime radar research to spectroscopy, which he foresaw as providing a powerful new tool for the study of the structure of atoms and molecules and as a potential new basis for controlling electromagnetic waves. 

In 1951, Dr. Townes and his associates at Columbia University began working on a device using ammonia gas as the active medium. In early 1954, this led to the first amplification and generation of electromagnetic waves by stimulated emission. He and his students coined the word “maser” for this device, an acronym for “microwave amplification by stimulated emission of radiation.” In 1958, Dr. Townes and his brother-in-law, Dr. A. L. Schawlow, showed theoretically that masers could be made to operate in the optical and infrared region and proposed how this could be accomplished in particular systems. This work resulted in their joint paper on optical and infrared masers, or lasers (“light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation”). In astronomy and nonlinear optics he discovered the first complex molecules in space and detected and determined the mass of the large black hole in the center of our galaxy. IIn 1961, Dr. Townes was appointed provost and professor of physics at MIT. In 1964, he shared the Nobel Prize in Physics with Nicolay Gennadiyevich Basov and Aleksandr Mikhailovich Prokhorov of the Lebedev Institute for Physics, Moscow, “for fundamental work in quantum electronics which has led to the construction of oscillators and amplifiers based on the maser-laser principle.” He was appointed University Professor at the University of California in 1967. Dr. Townes has served as a member of the Scientific Advisory Board of the United States Air Force and as chairman of the Strategic Weapons Panel of the Department of Defense. He is presently chairman of the Science and Technology Advisory Committee for Manned Space Flight of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and is a member of the President’s Science Advisory Committee. Dr. Townes has served the American Physical Society in various capacities and is currently vice president. He is also a Trustee of the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, the Carnegie Institution of Washington, and the RAND Corporation. His scientific writings have been published in many technical journals.
In addition to the Nobel Prize for Physics, Dr. Townes’ honors and awards include the Research Corporation Annual Award; the IRE Morris N.

Webster was inspired to go into this business after meeting a cardiologist who showed him how to modify existing catheters by adding thermistors and electrodes. Some ten years later, the development of electrophysiology gave rise to a new medical practice: curing patients with heart arrhythmias by radio-frequency ablation using catheters. A young electrophysiologist of Webster’s acquaintance convinced him that his products could be further modified for use in this emerging field. Webster’s company became very successful, and too large for him to run alone. It merged with another producer of cardiovascular catheters, Cordis Corporation, in 1994, Webster came to his profession by a somewhat circuitous route. After graduating from Caltech, he worked for eight years for CF Braun and Co., a designer and builder of oil refineries and chemical plants. For the subsequent 10 years he sold custom electronic components manufactured by small start-up companies that had formed in response to the space race.

He showed unusual perception in initiating work on paleomagnetic stratigraphy, planet-crossing asteroids, and continental-crust deep drilling. He created and nurtured the Astrogeology Branch of the United States Geological Survey. He worked on research on asteroids and comets, and on the satellites of Jupiter and Saturn at the USGA in Flagstaff, Arizona.

Dr. Townes received his M.A. in physics from Duke University in 1936 and his Ph.D. in 1939 from Caltech with a thesis on isotope separation and nuclear spins. Dr. Townes worked extensively during World War II in designing radar-bombing systems and holds a number of patents in related technology. He then turned his attention to applying the microwave technique of wartime radar research to spectroscopy, which he foresaw as providing a powerful new tool for the study of the structure of atoms and molecules and as a potential new basis for controlling electromagnetic waves. 

In 1951, Dr. Townes and his associates at Columbia University began working on a device using ammonia gas as the active medium. In early 1954, this led to the first amplification and generation of electromagnetic waves by stimulated emission. He and his students coined the word “maser” for this device, an acronym for “microwave amplification by stimulated emission of radiation.” In 1958, Dr. Townes and his brother-in-law, Dr. A. L. Schawlow, showed theoretically that masers could be made to operate in the optical and infrared region and proposed how this could be accomplished in particular systems. This work resulted in their joint paper on optical and infrared masers, or lasers (“light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation”). In astronomy and nonlinear optics he discovered the first complex molecules in space and detected and determined the mass of the large black hole in the center of our galaxy. IIn 1961, Dr. Townes was appointed provost and professor of physics at MIT. In 1964, he shared the Nobel Prize in Physics with Nicolay Gennadiyevich Basov and Aleksandr Mikhailovich Prokhorov of the Lebedev Institute for Physics, Moscow, “for fundamental work in quantum electronics which has led to the construction of oscillators and amplifiers based on the maser-laser principle.” He was appointed University Professor at the University of California in 1967. Dr. Townes has served as a member of the Scientific Advisory Board of the United States Air Force and as chairman of the Strategic Weapons Panel of the Department of Defense. He is presently chairman of the Science and Technology Advisory Committee for Manned Space Flight of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and is a member of the President’s Science Advisory Committee. Dr. Townes has served the American Physical Society in various capacities and is currently vice president. He is also a Trustee of the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, the Carnegie Institution of Washington, and the RAND Corporation. His scientific writings have been published in many technical journals.
In addition to the Nobel Prize for Physics, Dr. Townes’ honors and awards include the Research Corporation Annual Award; the IRE Morris N.

Dr. Townes received his M.A. in physics from Duke University in 1936 and his Ph.D. in 1939 from Caltech with a thesis on isotope separation and nuclear spins. Dr. Townes worked extensively during World War II in designing radar-bombing systems and holds a number of patents in related technology. He then turned his attention to applying the microwave technique of wartime radar research to spectroscopy, which he foresaw as providing a powerful new tool for the study of the structure of atoms and molecules and as a potential new basis for controlling electromagnetic waves. 

In 1951, Dr. Townes and his associates at Columbia University began working on a device using ammonia gas as the active medium. In early 1954, this led to the first amplification and generation of electromagnetic waves by stimulated emission. He and his students coined the word “maser” for this device, an acronym for “microwave amplification by stimulated emission of radiation.” In 1958, Dr. Townes and his brother-in-law, Dr. A. L. Schawlow, showed theoretically that masers could be made to operate in the optical and infrared region and proposed how this could be accomplished in particular systems. This work resulted in their joint paper on optical and infrared masers, or lasers (“light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation”). In astronomy and nonlinear optics he discovered the first complex molecules in space and detected and determined the mass of the large black hole in the center of our galaxy. IIn 1961, Dr. Townes was appointed provost and professor of physics at MIT. In 1964, he shared the Nobel Prize in Physics with Nicolay Gennadiyevich Basov and Aleksandr Mikhailovich Prokhorov of the Lebedev Institute for Physics, Moscow, “for fundamental work in quantum electronics which has led to the construction of oscillators and amplifiers based on the maser-laser principle.” He was appointed University Professor at the University of California in 1967. Dr. Townes has served as a member of the Scientific Advisory Board of the United States Air Force and as chairman of the Strategic Weapons Panel of the Department of Defense. He is presently chairman of the Science and Technology Advisory Committee for Manned Space Flight of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and is a member of the President’s Science Advisory Committee. Dr. Townes has served the American Physical Society in various capacities and is currently vice president. He is also a Trustee of the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, the Carnegie Institution of Washington, and the RAND Corporation.
